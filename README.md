# Introduction

This repository is the result of the tutorial to develop your first MERN application and you can find it [here](https://doregan.com/react-node-mongo)

## What you should install?

For this project, I decided to use the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) technology.

Firstly, you should install

-   [Mongo](https://www.mongodb.com/) 4.0.4+
-   [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) 4.16.3+
-   [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) 16.5.0+
-   [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) 11.4.0+ (It's recommended to use 10.15.1 LTS)

## Download

You can download the folder on my [GitHub](https://github.com/Oregand/) or you can do this directly on [this link](https://github.com/Oregand/mern).

If you have git installed on your PC, you just need do as follow:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/Oregand/mern.git
```

## Configuring App

If you have all the prerequisites installed you should verify if your MongoDB is up.

```
$ cd mern
$ cd server
$ yarn install
$ nodemon index.js
```

```
$ cd mern
$ cd client
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```
